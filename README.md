Image Steganography with Python

This project demonstrates how to conceal and retrieve secret messages within images using Python's OpenCV library. It employs the Least Significant Bit (LSB) technique to embed text into an image, ensuring minimal alteration to the original visual content.

Features

Message Embedding: Hide a secret message within an image by modifying its pixel values.

Password Protection: Secure the hidden message with a user-defined passcode.

Message Extraction: Retrieve and display the concealed message from the image using the correct passcode.
